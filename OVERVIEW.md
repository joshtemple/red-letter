# **Red Letter: Memorize the Commands of Jesus**

## **1\. Vision & Purpose**

A focused mobile app designed to help users internalize and memorize the commands of Jesus. The app prioritizes the sanctity and meaning of the text over complex features, utilizing a "less is more" philosophy to ensure the user’s primary interaction is with the words and their implications.

## **2\. Core Experience Principles**

* **Text-First Interface:** The design should feel more like a high-end typography book than a typical utility app. Every pixel should serve the legibility and impact of the text.  
* **Minimal Friction:** No complex navigation. The path from "app launch" to "memorization session" should be near-zero.  
* **Cognitive Respect:** No "attention-hacking" notifications or noisy UI. It respects the user's mental space and quietude.

## **3\. Memorization Strategy (The Science)**

The app leverages established learning science to move text from short-term to long-term memory:

* **Spaced Repetition (SRS):** An algorithm-backed schedule that presents commands at increasing intervals based on the user's mastery.  
* **Active Recall:** Rather than just reading, the app prompts the user to reconstruct the command through increasing levels of difficulty.  
* **Semantic Encoding:** Forcing the brain to process the *meaning* of a phrase before rote memorization, which creates deeper neural pathways.  
* **Dual Coding Theory:** Using both verbal (text) and non-verbal (minimalist visual mnemonics) channels to store information, providing multiple "hooks" for retrieval.  
* **Interleaving & Chunking:** Mixing commands and breaking longer verses into digestible semantic segments.

## **4\. Thoughtful Gamification**

In line with the Pareto Principle, we focus on the 20% of gamification that provides 80% of the motivation, avoiding "cheap" dopamine hits:

* **Progression Visualization:** A clean, non-numerical representation of mastery (e.g., a subtle growth of a visual element or a shift in background depth).  
* **Consistency Streaks:** A simple indicator of daily engagement, emphasizing habit over achievement.  
* **Mastery Milestones:** Recognition of commands "locked" into long-term memory.

## **5\. Functional Pillars**

### **A. The Living List**

The central repository of commands. Users can browse the full list, filtered by theme, book, or progress.

* **Visual Hooks:** Each entry in the list is accompanied by its unique **Minimalist Mnemonic**—a simple, symbolic piece of line art or an abstract shape that serves as the "non-verbal hook" for that specific command.

### **B. The Practice Engine (The Modes)**

The core interaction loop consists of five progressive modes that "fade" assistance, specifically engineered to combat rote association without comprehension:

1. **Impression Mode:**  
   * **Interaction:** The full text is displayed in beautiful typography alongside its unique **Visual Mnemonic**. The user reads the text and observes the image, allowing the "Dual Coding" to begin.  
2. **Reflection Mode (The Meaning):**
   * **Mandatory Gateway:** This mode is a mandatory prompt that appears after the initial impression but *before* any rote practice begins.
   * **Prompt:** *"In your own words, what does this command require of you?"*
   * **Goal:** The user types a brief summary or reflection. This forces **Semantic Encoding**, ensuring the user constructs a robust mental model of the command's intent. This prevents the brain from treating the text as a meaningless string of characters.  
3. **Scaffolding Mode (The Cloze):**  
   * **Interaction:** **Variable Ratio Occlusion**. Random words are hidden each visit. The user types only the missing words. This ensures the entire sentence structure is encoded rather than just specific segments.  
4. **Prompted Mode (The Reconstruction):**  
   * **Interaction:** A blank screen with a single input field. As the user types, the app validates the input character-by-character.  
   * **Anti-Cue Logic:** To avoid the **"Illusion of Competence,"** the app strictly avoids providing the first letter of every word as a static cue. Static cues often create "serial position" associations where the user learns to link a letter to a sequence without deep retrieval.  
   * **Refined Assistance:** The app uses **Sparse Prompting** (revealing the first letter of the *current* word only upon a manual "Hint" request or after a set period of inactivity) to force active retrieval from memory.  
5. **Reconstruction Mode (The Mastery):**  
   * **Interaction:** Total independent recall. A blank slate where the user types the entire command from memory. Feedback is given only at the end to simulate real-world recall.

### **C. The Scheduling Engine**

A silent orchestrator that determines which command the user sees next based on the SRS model. It determines when a user is ready to move from "Reflection" to "Reconstruction" based on speed and accuracy.

## **6\. Aesthetic Direction**

* **Typography:** Premium, high-contrast serif for the commands; clean sans-serif for UI.  
* **Visual Mnemonics:** Minimalist, symbolic art (e.g., a simple pencil drawing of a "Yoke" or a "Basin and Towel") that provides a visual anchor without being a distraction.

## **7\. Success Metrics**

* **Retention Rate:** Long-term recall vs. short-term recognition.  
* **Time-to-Task:** Efficiency of the "app-open to practice" flow.  
* **Cognitive Load:** User feedback on whether the "Semantic" prompt aids or hinders their feeling of connection to the text.
